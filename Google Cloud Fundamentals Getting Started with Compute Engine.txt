LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine
##Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

  * Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

  * Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

  * Connect between the two instances.

#Steps: Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console

 1. Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console
        gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" 
        --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default" --tags http

 2. Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line
        gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1
        gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1"
         --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"

 3. Connect between VM instances

      * Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
             ping my-vm-1

      * Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:
            ssh my-vm-1

        If you are prompted about whether you want to continue connecting to a host with unknown authenticity, 
        enter yes to confirm that you do.

      * At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
            sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

      * Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
            sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html


      * Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
            curl http://localhost/


      *To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
            curl http://my-vm-1/


Congratulations!
In this lab, you created virtual machine (VM) instances in two different zones and connected to them using ping, ssh, and HTTP.
